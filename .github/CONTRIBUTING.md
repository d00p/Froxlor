## Contributing.md

Before you start working on a PR, contact us via IRC or the forum to get a
clue whether someone else isn't already working on it or if we don't want to
invest the effort in favour of working on Froxlor 2.0.
Of course, bug fixes are always welcome.
However, at this stage of the 0.9.x branch, we are not looking for new
features or refactoring, especially not the kind which requires changes to a
lot of files.
Currently, we are working on a complete re-write, which, at this point in
time, is not yet public to keep delays due to discussions about internal
details to a minimum.
